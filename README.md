The script was made with groovy version 3.0.9 JVM 16.0.1
I have no idea about backwards compatiblity as I don't spend that much time coding groovy. (This is something I regret)
Please have installed at least that version or higher.
It requires two command-line arguments - the path of the input file (the .http file from jb) and the path of the output file.
Usage:

    groovy jb-postman.grooy ./my-file.http ./my-converted-file.json

If you find it interesting, please give a star.

I would like to see this functionality as a JetBrains plugin but I don't have knowledge about making them.
If anyone would like to collaborate on something like that, feel free to contact me here.
